# Requirements
ðŸ“¢ We don't currently give support to Godot 3+ as we focus on future stable versions from version 4 onwards
* Godot 4+

# âœ¨Installation
This is a template based repository, to start using you need to use the `Use template` green button on the top right corner of this repository.

This will fork the content from the main branch and initialize a fresh start new project with the first person controller ready to use.

# Global Settings
An autoload class is provided to manage the settings that could be useful to make them available to the player for exchange. Head movement and mouse sensitivity parameter may cause **motion sickness** in some people.

```py
@export_range(1, 10, 1) var MOUSE_SENSITIVITY = 3
@export var HEAD_BOBBING : = true
@export var MOTION_BLUR := true
@export var SWING_HEAD := false
```
